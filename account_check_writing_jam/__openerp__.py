With this module, you will be able to write checks to your vendors in OpenERP.
==============================================================================

DON'T INSTALL account_check_writing!!

This module supports the following:
-----------------------------------
    * Multiple currencies: it is possible to write checks in different currencies.
    * Multiple journals: each check can use a different payment method.
    * Multiple formats: checks can be printed on top, in the middle or at the bottom to fit Quickbooks/Peachtree/... templates.
    * Batch check number assignation.
    * Batch printing of checks.
    * Complete check number sequence management: number auto-suggestion, sequence recalibration, optional overwrite if already specified, duplicates detection.
    * Optional printing of check number: if the paper checks of your bank already include numbers, you can use these numbers instead of OpenERPâ€™s check numbers.
    * Optional spill-over on multiple stubs: when the check includes more than 10 invoice lines, they will be printed  on several pages.
    * Optional printing of credits.
    * Integration with payments workflow: checks are an integrated part of the payment workflow in OpenERP.
    * Comprehensive and accurate information displayed on stub: supplier's invoice number, void status, memo, suppresses invoices that are not paid with this check.
